Instructions

1) create 400px wide and 120px wide versions of:
firefox_logo-only_RGB.png
firefox-addons.jpg
mozilla-dinosaur-head.png

(filenaming eg firefoxlogo400.png)

optimize all and save inside the main directory.

Along with mdn.svg, these images will be your icons to link to further resources, inside the further-info area.
You'll also link to the firefox logo in the site header.

2) create a 1200px wide landscape version of red-panda.jpg, and a 600px wide portrait version that shows the panda in more of a close up shot.
optimize and save inside the main directory.

3) Inside the <header> element, add an <img> element that will embed the small version of the Firefox logo in the header.

4) Just inside the <article> element (right below the opening tag), embed the YouTube video found at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojcNcvb1olg
using the appropriate YouTube tools to generate the code. The video should be 400px wide.

5) Inside the <div> with the class of further-info you will find four <a> elements — each one linking to an interesting Mozilla-related page.
insert an <img> element inside each one containing appropriate src, alt, srcset and sizes attributes. 
Make sure you match the correct images with the correct links!

In each case (except one — which one is inherently responsive?) we want the browser to serve the 120px wide version when the viewport width
is 500px wide or less, or the 400px wide version otherwise.

6) Inside the <div> with the class of red-panda, we want to insert a <picture> element
that serves the small portrait panda image if the viewport is 600px wide or less, and the large landscape image otherwise.

7) upload your site to a server (using Github pages is an easy and free solution)
from there you can test whether the srcset/sizes examples are working properly using browser developer tools.

compare your page to the examples provided.
